	<h1>Tab Panel</h1>
	<p>A tab panel consists of tabs, which are always visible, and tab panels, only one of which is visible at a time, depending on the active tab. When a tab is activated, its corresponding panel becomes visible, and all other tab panels are hidden.</p>

	<p><strong>Keyboard:</strong> Navigate to the tab panel widget using the Tab key. Then use the arrow keys to move between the tabs.</p>

	<p><strong>Screen Reader:</strong> For each tab, the screen reader should read the name, role, and the tab's place in the tab list plus a count of the total number of tabs. (e.g., "Perceivable, tab, 1 of 4")</p>

      Making content <em>perceivable</em> means making the <strong>output</strong>
      available to the user's senses, namely sight, sound, and touch (in the case
      of people who use Braille output devices). We won't worry about tasting or
      smelling web pages!

    <div role="tabpanel" id="panel-operable">
      Making content <em>operable</em> means making the <strong>input mechanisms</strong>
