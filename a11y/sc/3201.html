                    <p>For example, opening a new window, moving focus to a different component, going to a new page (including anything that would look to a user as if they had moved to a new page) or significantly re-arranging the content of a page are examples of changes of context.</p>

                    <p>Note 1: Multiple user interface components may be implemented as a single programmatic element. "Components" here is not tied to programming techniques, but rather to what the user perceives as separate controls.</p>
                    <p>Note 2: User interface components include form elements and links as well as components generated by scripts.</p>
                    <p>Note 3: What is meant by "component" or "user interface component" here is also sometimes called "user interface element".</p>
