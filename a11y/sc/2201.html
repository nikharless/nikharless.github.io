            <p>For each time limit that is set by the content, at least one of the following is true:</p>

            <dl>
                <dt><strong>Turn off</strong></dt>
                <dd>The user is allowed to turn off the time limit before encountering it; or</dd>
                <dt><strong>Adjust</strong></dt>
                <dd>The user is allowed to adjust the time limit before encountering it over a wide range that is at least ten times the length of the default setting; or</dd>
                <dt><strong>Extend</strong></dt>
                <dd>The user is warned before time expires and given at least 20 seconds to extend the time limit with a simple action (for example, "press the space bar"), and the user is allowed to extend the time limit at least ten times; or</dd>
                <dt><strong>Real-time Exception</strong></dt>
                <dd>The time limit is a required part of a real-time event (for example, an auction), and no alternative to the time limit is possible; or</dd>
                <dt><strong>Essential Exception</strong></dt>
                <dd>The time limit is essential and extending it would invalidate the activity; or</dd>
                <dt><strong>20 Hour Exception</strong></dt>
                <dd>The time limit is longer than 20 hours.</dd>
            </dl>

            <p><strong>Note</strong>: This success criterion helps ensure that users can complete tasks without unexpected changes in content or context that are a result of a time limit. This success criterion should be considered in conjunction with <a href="/a11y/sc/3201.html">Success Criterion 3.2.1</a>, which puts limits on changes of content or context as a result of user action.</p>
