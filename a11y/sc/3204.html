                    <p>Examples:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A publication which is split across multiple web pages, where each page contains one chapter or other significant section of the work. The publication is logically a single contiguous unit, and contains navigation features that enable access to the full set of pages.</li>
                        <li>An e-commerce website shows products in a set of web pages that all share the same navigation and identification. However, when progressing to the checkout process, the template changes; the navigation and other elements are removed, so the pages in that process are functionally and visually different. The checkout pages are not part of the set of product pages.</li>
                        <li>A blog on a sub-domain (e.g., blog.example.com) which has a different navigation and is authored by a distinct set of people from the pages on the primary domain (example.com).</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Note: Different language versions would be considered different sets of web pages.</p>
