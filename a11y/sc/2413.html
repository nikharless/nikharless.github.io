            <p>When the keyboard focus indicator is visible, an area of the focus indicator meets all the following:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>is at least as large as the area of a 2 CSS pixel thick perimeter of the unfocused component or sub-component, and</li>
                <li>has a contrast ratio of at least 3:1 between the same pixels in the focused and unfocused states.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Exceptions:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>The focus indicator is determined by the user agent and cannot be adjusted by the author, or</li>
                <li>The focus indicator and the indicator's background color are not modified by the author.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Note</strong>: What is perceived as the user interface component or sub-component (to determine enclosure or size) depends on its visual presentation. The visual presentation includes the component's visible content, border, and component-specific background. It does not include shadow and glow effects outside the component's content, background, or border.</p>

            <p><strong>Note</strong>: Examples of sub-components that may receive a focus indicator are menu items in an opened drop-down menu, or focusable cells in a grid.</p>

            <p><strong>Note</strong>: Contrast calculations can be based on colors defined within the technology (such as HTML, CSS and SVG). Pixels modified by user agent resolution enhancements and anti-aliasing can be ignored.</p>
