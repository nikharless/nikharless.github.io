            <p>If keyboard focus can be moved to a component of the page using a keyboard interface, then focus can be moved away from that component using only a keyboard interface, and, if it requires more than unmodified <kbd>arrow</kbd> or <kbd>tab</kbd> keys or other standard exit methods, the user is advised of the method for moving focus away.</p>

            <p><strong>Note</strong>: Since any content that does not meet this success criterion can interfere with a user's ability to use the whole page, all content on the Web page (whether it is used to meet other success criteria or not) must meet this success criterion. See <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/no-keyboard-trap#cc5">Conformance Requirement 5: Non-Interference.</a></p>

                    <p>Note 1: A keyboard interface allows users to provide keystroke input to programs even if the native technology does not contain a keyboard.</p>
                    <p>Note 2: Operation of the application (or parts of the application) through a keyboard-operated mouse emulator, such as MouseKeys, does not qualify as operation through a keyboard interface because operation of the program is through its pointing device interface, not through its keyboard interface.</p>
