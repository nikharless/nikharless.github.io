            <p>All non-text content that is presented to the user has a text alternative that serves the equivalent purpose, except for the situations listed below.</p>

            <dl>
                <dt><strong>Controls, Input</strong></dt>
                <dd>If non-text content is a control or accepts user input, then it has a name that describes its purpose. (Refer to Success Criterion 4.1.2 for additional requirements for controls and content that accepts user input.)</dd>
                <dt><strong>Time-Based Media</strong></dt>
                <dd>If non-text content is time-based media, then text alternatives at least provide descriptive identification of the non-text content. (Refer to Guideline 1.2 for additional requirements for media.)</dd>
                <dt><strong>Test</strong></dt>
                <dd>If non-text content is a test or exercise that would be invalid if presented in text, then text alternatives at least provide descriptive identification of the non-text content.</dd>
                <dt><strong>Sensory</strong></dt>
                <dd>If non-text content is primarily intended to create a specific sensory experience, then text alternatives at least provide descriptive identification of the non-text content.</dd>
                <dt><strong>CAPTCHA</strong></dt>
                <dd>If the purpose of non-text content is to confirm that content is being accessed by a person rather than a computer, then text alternatives that identify and describe the purpose of the non-text content are provided, and alternative forms of CAPTCHA using output modes for different types of sensory perception are provided to accommodate different disabilities.</dd>
                <dt><strong>Decoration, Formatting, Invisible</strong></dt>
                <dd>If non-text content is pure decoration, is used only for visual formatting, or is not presented to users, then it is implemented in a way that it can be ignored by assistive technology.</dd>
