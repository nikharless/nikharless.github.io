            <p>For all user interface components (including but not limited to: form elements, links and components generated by scripts), the name and role can be programmatically determined; states, properties, and values that can be set by the user can be programmatically set; and notification of changes to these items is available to user agents, including assistive technologies.</p>

            <p><strong>Note</strong>: This success criterion is primarily for Web authors who develop or script their own user interface components. For example, standard HTML controls already meet this success criterion when used according to specification.</p>

                <dt>assistive technology</dt>
                <dd>hardware and/or software that acts as a user agent, or along with a mainstream user agent, to provide functionality to meet the requirements of users with disabilities that go beyond those offered by mainstream user agents.
                    <p>Note: Functionality provided by assistive technology includes alternative presentations (e.g., as synthesized speech or magnified content), alternative input methods (e.g., voice), additional navigation or orientation mechanisms, and content transformations (e.g., to make tables more accessible).</p>
                    <p>Note: Assistive technologies often communicate data and messages with mainstream user agents by using and monitoring APIs.</p>
                    <p>Note: The distinction between mainstream user agents and assistive technologies is not absolute. Many mainstream user agents provide some features to assist individuals with disabilities. The basic difference is that mainstream user agents target broad and diverse audiences that usually include people with and without disabilities. Assistive technologies target narrowly defined populations of users with specific disabilities. The assistance provided by an assistive technology is more specific and appropriate to the needs of its target users. The mainstream user agent may provide important functionality to assistive technologies like retrieving web content from program objects or parsing markup into identifiable bundles.</p>

                    <p>Example: Assistive technologies that are important in the context of this document include the following:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>screen magnifiers, and other visual reading assistants, which are used by people with visual, perceptual and physical print disabilities to change text font, size, spacing, color, synchronization with speech, etc. in order to improve the visual readability of rendered text and images;</li>
                        <li>screen readers, which are used by people who are blind to read textual information through synthesized speech or braille;</li>
                        <li>text-to-speech software, which is used by some people with cognitive, language, and learning disabilities to convert text into synthetic speech;</li>
                        <li>speech recognition software, which may be used by people who have some physical disabilities;</li>
                        <li>alternative keyboards, which are used by people with certain physical disabilities to simulate the keyboard (including alternate keyboards that use head pointers, single switches, sip/puff and other special input devices.);</li>
                        <li>alternative pointing devices, which are used by people with certain physical disabilities to simulate mouse pointing and button activations.</li>
                    </ul>
                </dd>

                <dt>name</dt>
                <dd>text by which software can identify a component within web content to the user
                    <p>Note: The name may be hidden and only exposed by assistive technology, whereas a label is presented to all users. In many (but not all) cases, the label and the name are the same.</p>
                    <p>Note: This is unrelated to the <code>name</code> attribute in HTML.</p>
                </dd>

                <dt>programmatically determined</dt>
                <dd>determined by software from author-supplied data provided in a way that different user agents, including assistive technologies, can extract and present this information to users in different modalities</dd>

                <dt>programmatically set</dt>
                <dd>set by software using methods that are supported by user agents, including assistive technologies</dd>

                <dt>role</dt>
                <dd>text or number by which software can identify the function of a component within web content</dd>

                <dt>state</dt>
                <dd>
                    <p>dynamic property expressing characteristics of a user interface component that may change in response to user action or automated processes</p>
                    <p>States do not affect the nature of the component, but represent data associated with the component or user interaction possibilities. Examples include focus, hover, select, press, check, visited/unvisited, and expand/collapse.</p>
                </dd>

                <dt>user agent</dt>
                <dd>any software that retrieves and presents web content for users (e.g., web browsers, media players, plug-ins, and assistive technologies)</dd>

                <dt>user interface component</dt>
                <dd>a part of the content that is perceived by users as a single control for a distinct function
                    <p>Note: Multiple user interface components may be implemented as a single programmatic element. "Components" here is not tied to programming techniques, but rather to what the user perceives as separate controls.</p>
                    <p>Note: User interface components include form elements and links as well as components generated by scripts.</p>
                    <p>Note: What is meant by "component" or "user interface component" here is also sometimes called "user interface element".
