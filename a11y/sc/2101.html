            <p>All functionality of the content is operable through a keyboard interface without requiring specific timings for individual keystrokes, except where the underlying function requires input that depends on the path of the user's movement and not just the endpoints.</p>

            <p><strong>Note</strong>: This exception relates to the underlying function, not the input technique. For example, if using handwriting to enter text, the input technique (handwriting) requires path-dependent input but the underlying function (text input) does not.</p>

            <p><strong>Note</strong>: This does not forbid and should not discourage providing mouse input or other input methods in addition to keyboard operation.</p>

                    <p>Note: A keyboard interface allows users to provide keystroke input to programs even if the native technology does not contain a keyboard (e.g., touchscreen, speech-to-text, switch).</p>
                    <p>Note: Operation of the application (or parts of the application) through a keyboard-operated mouse emulator, such as MouseKeys, does not qualify as operation through a keyboard interface because operation of the program is through its pointing device interface, not through its keyboard interface.</p>
