            <p>For Web pages that cause legal commitments or financial transactions for the user to occur, that modify or delete user-controllable data in data storage systems, or that submit user test responses, at least one of the following is true:</p>

            <dl>
                <dt><strong>Reversible</strong></dt>
                <dd>Submissions are reversible.</dd>
                <dt><strong>Checked</strong></dt>
                <dd>Data entered by the user is checked for input errors and the user is provided an opportunity to correct them.</dd>
                <dt><strong>Confirmed</strong></dt>
                <dd>A mechanism is available for reviewing, confirming, and correcting information before finalizing the submission.</dd>

                    <p>Note: This includes information that is required by the web page but omitted by the user and information that is provided by the user but that falls outside the required data format or values.</p>

                <dt>legal commitments</dt>
                <dd>transactions where the person incurs a legally binding obligation or benefit
                    <p>For example, a marriage license, a stock trade (financial and legal), a will, a loan, adoption, signing up for the army, a contract of any type, etc.</p></dd>

                <dd>process or technique for achieving a result
                    <p>Note 1: The mechanism may be explicitly provided in the content, or may be relied upon to be provided by either the platform or by user agents, including assistive technologies.</p>
                    <p>Note 2: The mechanism needs to meet all success criteria for the conformance level claimed.</p>

                <dd>a non-embedded resource obtained from a single URI using HTTP plus any other resources that are used in the rendering or intended to be rendered together with it by a user agent
                    <p>Note 1: Although any "other resources" would be rendered together with the primary resource, they would not necessarily be rendered simultaneously with each other.</p>
                    <p>Note 2: For the purposes of conformance with these guidelines, a resource must be "non-embedded" within the scope of conformance to be considered a web page.</p>
