                    <p>Note: Items are considered to be in the same relative order even if other items are inserted or removed from the original order. For example, expanding navigation menus may insert an additional level of detail or a secondary navigation section may be inserted into the reading order.</p>

                <dd>collection of web pages that share a common purpose and that are created by the same author, group, or organization
                    <p>Examples:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A publication which is split across multiple web pages, where each page contains one chapter or other significant section of the work. The publication is logically a single contiguous unit, and contains navigation features that enable access to the full set of pages.</li>
                        <li>An e-commerce website shows products in a set of web pages that all share the same navigation and identification. However, when progressing to the checkout process, the template changes; the navigation and other elements are removed, so the pages in that process are functionally and visually different. The checkout pages are not part of the set of product pages.</li>
                        <li>A blog on a sub-domain (e.g., blog.example.com) which has a different navigation and is authored by a distinct set of people from the pages on the primary domain (example.com).</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Note: Different language versions would be considered different sets of web pages.</p>

                <dt>web page</dt>
                <dd>a non-embedded resource obtained from a single URI using HTTP plus any other resources that are used in the rendering or intended to be rendered together with it by a user agent
                    <p>Note 1: Although any "other resources" would be rendered together with the primary resource, they would not necessarily be rendered simultaneously with each other.</p>
                    <p>For the purpose of conformance with these guidelines, a resource must be "non-embedded" within the scope of conformance to be considered a web page.</p>
                    <p>Examples:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A web resource including all embedded images and media</li>
                        <li>A web mail program that lives entirely at a single url but includes an inbox, a contacts area, and a calendar. Links or buttons are provided that cause the inbox, contacts, or calendar to display but do not change the URI of the page as a whole.</li>
                        <li>A customizable portal site, where users can choose content to display from a set of different content modules.</li>
                        <li>A movie-like interactive shopping environment where you visually move around in a store dragging products off of the shelves areound you and into a visual shopping cart in front of you. This might be a single-page website or just one page within a website.</li>
