            <p>Web pages do not contain anything that flashes more than three times in any one second period, or the flash is below the general flash and red flash thresholds.</p>

            <p><strong>Note</strong>: Since any content that does not meet this success criterion can interfere with a user's ability to use the whole page, all content on the Web page (whether it is used to meet other success criteria or not) must meet this success criterion.
